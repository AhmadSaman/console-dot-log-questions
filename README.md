# Console Log Questions
This Projects contains all the questions inside [Console Logame](https://github.com/AhmadSaman/console-dot-logame)

### Aim of this Project ?
Questions inside [Console Logame](https://github.com/AhmadSaman/console-dot-logame) must be in a format that is valid to use, and getting the questions from other repositories and format them to a spicific format is the aim of this repository

### Format Example:
if you check the files you will see a file called `a-questions.md` this file is from [lydiahallie/javascript-questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)s repository, and the formatted one from this markdown file is all the fules that start with `a-NUMBER.md` with the following format:

`a-questions.md`(raw MD questions) has own file that includes the logic that will format it to valid Md files to use it later inside [Console Logame](https://github.com/AhmadSaman/console-dot-logame)
this is one example and this applies to all the other raw files (`b-questions.md`, ...etc) that come in the future that will be fomatted 

**note**: to see all questions check `/questions` folder
