# Console Log Questions
This Projects contains all the questions inside [Console Logame](https://github.com/AhmadSaman/console-dot-logame)

### Aim of this Project ?
Questions inside [Console Logame](https://github.com/AhmadSaman/console-dot-logame) must be in a format that is valid to use, and getting the questions from other repositories and format them to a spicific format is the aim of this repository

### Format Example:
if you check the files you will see a file called `a-questions.md` this file is from [lydiahallie/javascript-questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)s repository, and the formatted one from this markdown file is all the fules that start with `a-NUMBER.md` with the following format:

`a-questions.md`(raw MD questions) has own file that includes the logic that will format it to valid Md files to use it later inside [Console Logame](https://github.com/AhmadSaman/console-dot-logame)
this is one example and this applies to all the other raw files (`b-questions.md`, ...etc) that come in the future that will be fomatted 

**note**: to see all questions check `/questions` folder

### Can I contirbute ?
- Yes, there is no fun doing all this alone you can get any javascript multichoice repository and formatted to a valid quetions, how to do it ?, easy create your JS file inside `./format/r-format.js` exportted and call it inside index or just run you file `node file_name.js` then check if every thing looks fine then create a PR on this repository 
- Another way to contirbute is the original project [Console Logame](https://github.com/AhmadSaman/console-dot-logame), open an issue there I will create an issue for you to work on it, but the project it still in progress there is alot to do
